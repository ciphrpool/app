## 5. Binary System

### 5.1 Understanding Binaries

Binaries are powerful programs that exist outside the normal match environment. These specialized tools represent concentrated fragments of advanced programming knowledge that your AI can leverage during matches. Unlike machines, which are constructed during gameplay, binaries are collected and curated before matches begin, forming part of your strategic loadout.

### 5.2 Binary Collection

Players build their binary collection over time, acquiring these powerful tools through various means. Each binary represents a unique capability or strategic option. However, you can only bring a limited selection of five binaries into each match, making your collection and selection choices crucial to your overall strategy.

### 5.3 Strategic Selection

The five-binary limit forces careful consideration of which tools to bring into each match. When selecting your binary loadout, consider how they complement each other and your overall strategy. Some binaries might excel at early game advantage, while others could provide crucial late-game turning points or defensive options when under pressure.

### 5.4 Cost & Rewards

Each binary comes with specific costs and potential rewards. Costs can be paid in either energy or data, making the timing of binary usage crucial. Some binaries might offer immediate benefits while others could provide ongoing advantages or resource generation. Understanding these cost-reward relationships is key to effective binary usage during matches.

### 5.5 Binary Effects

#### 5.5.1 Memory Manipulation

Some binaries can interact directly with memory systems, affecting how data is stored, processed, or utilized. These powerful tools can potentially alter the fundamental ways your AI operates during a match.

#### 5.5.2 Grid Interaction

Grid interaction binaries can affect the physical space of the match, potentially altering terrain, affecting machine placement, or creating new strategic opportunities. These binaries can dramatically change the tactical landscape of a match.

#### 5.5.3 Opponent Interference

The most aggressive category of binaries focuses on disrupting opponent operations. These tools can potentially interfere with opponent cursors, machines, or resource generation, creating opportunities for tactical advantages.
