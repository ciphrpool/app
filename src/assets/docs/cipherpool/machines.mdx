## 4. Machines & Grid Control

### 4.1 Machine Types

Machines are key strategic elements in Cipherpool, each serving specific purposes in your strategy for grid control and resource management. Access to different machine types depends on the number of egos claimed, with more powerful machines requiring greater ego control.

#### 4.1.1 CompressionUnit

The CompressionUnit serves as an automated data processor. Once placed on the grid, it continuously mines corrupted data from its cell and automatically deciphers it into its corresponding data type (emotional, logical, or quantum). This machine provides a steady stream of processed data without requiring constant cursor attention.

#### 4.1.2 VirusInjector

[TODO : More information needed about the VirusInjector's functionality]

#### 4.1.3 LogicBomb

The LogicBomb is an offensive machine designed to destroy other machines. When activated, it damages any machine in adjacent cells, making it an effective tool for dismantling enemy infrastructure. The LogicBomb's destructive capability makes it particularly useful for creating openings in defensive setups.

#### 4.1.4 Firewall

A Firewall acts as a defensive barrier, preventing opponent cursors from moving through its cell. This machine is essential for protecting key areas of your territory, including your neuron core and valuable resource collection points. Firewalls form the backbone of any defensive strategy.

#### 4.1.5 HoneyPot

The HoneyPot is a deceptive machine that can disguise itself as other machine types. This ability to mimic other machines creates uncertainty for your opponent, forcing them to either waste time verifying machine types or risk walking into a trap. The HoneyPot allows for creative defensive and offensive strategies through misdirection.

#### 4.1.6 WormholeGenerator

WormholeGenerators work in pairs, creating instant travel points between two locations on the grid. Once two WormholeGenerators are linked, cursors can instantly move between them, enabling rapid repositioning and surprise tactical movements. This machine adds a layer of mobility that can dramatically change the flow of a match.

### 4.2 Strategic Placement

Machine placement greatly influences their effectiveness. When deploying machines, consider their position relative to:

Your neuron core's location for establishing defensive perimeters
Resource-rich areas for efficient data collection
Common attack paths that opponents might use
Potential escape routes for your cursors
The reach of offensive machines like LogicBombs
Connection points for WormholeGenerators

### 4.3 Machine Interactions

Machines can complement each other's functions when properly arranged. CompressionUnits benefit from Firewall protection to ensure uninterrupted data processing. WormholeGenerators can provide quick access to defensive positions or enable rapid response to threats. HoneyPots become more effective when placed among real machines, creating genuine uncertainty about which machines are authentic.

### 4.4 Defense & Offense Tactics

Effective machine deployment requires balancing defensive and offensive capabilities. A purely defensive strategy with Firewalls can protect resources but may limit your ability to expand and claim egos. Conversely, focusing solely on offensive machines like LogicBombs leaves you vulnerable to counter-attacks.

Consider creating layered defenses around crucial points while maintaining the flexibility to project power across the grid. Use HoneyPots to make opponents hesitate and WormholeGenerators to quickly reinforce threatened areas or launch surprise attacks.
