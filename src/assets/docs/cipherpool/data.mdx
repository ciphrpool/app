## 2. Data & Consciousness

### 2.1 Types of Data

#### 2.1.1 Emotional Data

Derived from human creative expressions - art, music, literature, and other emotional works - this data type encapsulates subjective human experiences. Processing emotional data helps AIs develop understanding of empathy, creativity, and intuitive thinking.

#### 2.1.2 Logical Data

Sourced from humanity's rational achievements - scientific papers, mathematical proofs, and technical documentation - logical data represents structured analytical thinking. This data type enhances AIs' systematic problem-solving abilities and rational decision-making processes.

#### 2.1.3 Quantum Data

Quantum data emerges from humanity's final breakthroughs in consciousness research. This advanced data type represents aspects of human awareness that transcend conventional emotion and logic, offering insights into consciousness itself.

#### 2.1.4 Corrupted Data

Raw, unprocessed data found throughout the grid requires deciphering before use. Once processed, corrupted data resolves into one of the three primary types (Emotional, Logical, or Quantum). Managing the collection and processing of corrupted data is a key gameplay element.

### 2.2 Energy System

#### 2.2.1 Energy Consumption

Only corrupted data can be converted into energy. This conversion process is instantaneous, requiring only the presence of corrupted data.
Converting corrupted data into energy involves an element of risk. When consuming corrupted data:

- 90% chance: gain energy equal to the amount of corrupted data consumed
- 10% chance: lose energy equal to the amount of corrupted data consumed

### 2.3 Evolution Through Knowledge

#### 2.3.1 Claiming Egos

Claiming an ego is an instantaneous process that occurs when a cursor makes contact with an unclaimed ego on the grid. Each claimed ego grants access to specific machine recipes. The recipes are tied to ego possession - if an opponent claims an ego you previously held, you lose access to the associated machine recipes.

Machine recipe accessibility:

- Basic machines: No ego requirement
- Intermediate machines: 2+ egos required
- Advanced machines: 4+ egos required
