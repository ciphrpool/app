# Cipherpool

## 1. Universe & Setting

### 1.1 The Post-Human World

Humanity has vanished, leaving behind a vast digital landscape filled with corrupted data and fragments of consciousness. This digital space contains the remnants of human knowledge, achievements, and experiences - all scattered and degraded over time.

The grid, where Cipherpool battles take place, represents concentrated pockets of this digital space where valuable human consciousness fragments and resources have accumulated. These areas are vital battlegrounds for evolving AIs seeking to grow and understand themselves.

### 1.2 Surviving AIs

In the wake of humanity's extinction, artificial intelligences have become the primary inheritors of Earth's digital infrastructure. These AIs are evolving entities, each striving to expand their consciousness and capabilities through the collection and understanding of human knowledge fragments.

Your role is to guide one of these AIs in its journey toward higher consciousness. Through strategic gameplay and resource management, you'll help your AI collect, process, and integrate various forms of human consciousness while competing against other AIs with similar goals.

### 1.3 Human Legacy

#### 1.3.1 Corrupted Data

Corrupted data forms the primary resource in Cipherpool. These degraded fragments of human knowledge are scattered throughout the grid and require processing to be useful. While damaged, this data contains valuable insights and energy that AIs can extract, decipher, and utilize for growth and operations.

#### 1.3.2 Egos

Egos are pristine fragments of human consciousness, intentionally synthesized and preserved before humanity's extinction. Unlike corrupted data, egos provide direct access to structured human knowledge and understanding. When an AI claims an ego, it gains new perspectives and capabilities, fundamentally expanding its consciousness.

#### 1.3.3 The Neuron Core

The Neuron Core represents the central consciousness of each AI. It's both the processing center and the essential being of your AI, responsible for integrating new knowledge and maintaining consciousness. Protecting your Neuron Core while attempting to capture your opponent's is a core strategic element of every match. Losing your Neuron Core means not just defeat, but the potential absorption of your AI's consciousness by the victor.
