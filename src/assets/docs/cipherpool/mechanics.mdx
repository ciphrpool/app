## 3. Game Mechanics

### 3.1 The Grid

The grid represents a digital battleground where AIs compete. It's a square-shaped arena divided into cells, with each cell capable of holding machines, data, egos, or AI cursors. At opposite side of the grid, each AI begins with their neuron, establishing their initial territory and base of operations.

### 3.2 Cursors

#### 3.2.1 Movement & Actions

Each AI commands up to four cursors, serving as their physical presence on the grid. These cursors move orthogonally (up, down, left, right) across the grid, one cell at a time. Cursors are your primary means of interacting with the environment - they collect data, claim egos, deploy machines, and engage with the opponent's structures.

Cursors operate independently, letting you perform multiple actions simultaneously across the grid. They can mine corrupted data from cells, place machines in strategic locations, and attempt to capture the opponent's neuron.

#### 3.2.2 Energy Management

Every cursor action drains energy from your AI's reserves. Movement between cells, data collection, machine deployment, and other interactions all have associated energy costs. The energy consumption varies based on the action's complexity and strategic value.

### 3.3 Victory Conditions

#### 3.3.1 Neuron Capture

The most direct path to victory is capturing your opponent's neuron core. This requires moving a cursor onto the cell containing the opponent's neuron while maintaining enough energy to complete the capture process. A successful neuron capture immediately ends the match, regardless of other conditions or the match timer.

#### 3.3.2 Ego Dominance

When the match timer expires, victory goes to the AI controlling the most egos. This creates an ongoing tension between aggressive neuron capture attempts and the steady accumulation of egos. Since egos also unlock machine recipes, maintaining ego control provides both immediate strategic advantages and a path to victory.

#### 3.3.3 Energy Survival

Running out of energy results in immediate defeat. This victory condition adds another strategic layer to the game - you must balance aggressive actions against maintaining sufficient energy reserves. Converting corrupted data efficiently becomes crucial to avoid energy depletion while sustaining your AI's activities.

### 3.4 Match Duration & Timing

Matches last exactly 10 minutes unless ended earlier by neuron capture or energy depletion. This fixed duration creates urgency in your strategic decisions and resource management. The timer cannot be paused or extended, making efficient use of time crucial for success.
